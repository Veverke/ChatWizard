# Change Log

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-22

- **Workspace Management** — new `Manage Watched Workspaces` command lets you select exactly which Copilot and Claude workspaces to index; shows size and session count per workspace; persists selection and restarts the watcher.
- **Model Usage panel** — new sidebar tab showing per-model user request counts over a configurable date range, with workspace and session drill-down and friendly model name normalisation.
- **Timeline enhancements** — added activity heat map (click a day to filter), work burst clustering (2-hour window), per-week topic drift ribbon, summary stats bar (streak, active days, on-this-day), and inline keyword search.
