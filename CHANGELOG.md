# Change Log

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-05

- **MCP Server Mode** — expose your full chat history as a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server so that AI tools can query past conversations as live context when answering new questions. The server binds to `localhost` only, is disabled by default, and requires a bearer token for every request.
  - Enable via `chatwizard.mcpServer.enabled: true` (default `false`). Port configurable via `chatwizard.mcpServer.port` (default `6789`).
  - **8 MCP tools:** `chatwizard_search` (full-text), `chatwizard_find_similar` (semantic), `chatwizard_get_session` (truncated content), `chatwizard_get_session_full` (no truncation), `chatwizard_list_recent`, `chatwizard_get_context` (smart context), `chatwizard_list_sources`, `chatwizard_server_info`.
  - **3 new commands:** `Chat Wizard: Start MCP Server`, `Chat Wizard: Stop MCP Server`, `Chat Wizard: Copy MCP Config to Clipboard`.
  - **Config clipboard flow** — `Copy MCP Config` shows a quick-pick (GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Continue, Generic) and copies a ready-to-paste JSON snippet to the clipboard, then opens per-tool setup instructions in a read-only document.
  - **Status bar indicator** — a `$(broadcast) MCP` item reflects server state and provides one-click start/stop.
  - **First-run consent modal** — on first start, a modal explains what the server does before generating the bearer token.
  - **`NullSemanticIndexer`** — semantic tool paths degrade gracefully when semantic search is disabled.
  - See [docs/mcp-setup-guide.md](docs/mcp-setup-guide.md) for per-tool setup instructions.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-30

- **Topic similarity search** — new `Find Sessions by Topic` command (`chatwizard.semanticSearch`) finds past sessions by topic rather than keywords, powered by a local `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` ONNX model (~22 MB, downloaded on first use after a consent prompt; `@xenova/transformers` bundled externally). Disabled by default; enable via `chatwizard.enableSemanticSearch`. The index stores one vector per user message and one per paragraph of each AI response (split on `\n\n`), keeping each embedding within the model's 256-token window. Vectors are persisted to `semantic-embeddings.bin` using a composite key `"sessionId::role::messageIndex::paragraphIndex"` per entry. Minimum similarity score is configurable via `chatwizard.semanticMinScore` (default `0.35`; recommended range `0.30–0.45`). A scope toggle cycles `Both → My questions → AI responses → Both` to restrict the search to user-message or assistant-paragraph vectors. Model loading and background indexing surface progress via `vscode.window.withProgress`. The full-text search quick-pick (`chatwizard.search`) shows a `$(sparkle)` button to switch directly to topic similarity search.
- **Search results deduplicated by session** — the keyword search quick-pick (`chatwizard.search`) now shows at most one result per session (the highest-scoring hit), eliminating duplicate entries when multiple snippets from the same session matched the query.

- **Google Antigravity support** — indexes agent conversations from Google Antigravity (Google’s VS Code-fork AI IDE) stored as JSONL step logs at `~/.gemini/antigravity/brain/<uuid>/.system_generated/logs/overview.txt`. User messages are extracted from `<USER_REQUEST>` XML envelopes; tool-only model steps are skipped; AI responses come from `PLANNER_RESPONSE` steps that carry text content. Session title is derived from the first user message (max 120 chars). Configurable via `chatwizard.indexAntigravity` and `chatwizard.antigravityBrainPath`.
- Antigravity sessions participate fully in full-text search, the prompt library, code block extraction, analytics, model usage, timeline, and source filtering across all panels.
- Token counting for Antigravity sessions uses the character ÷ 4 Gemini approximation (same as Claude) rather than the GPT word-based heuristic.
- `modelUsageEngine`: Antigravity sessions with no model field fall back to the label `Gemini Auto`.
- Antigravity brand icon (gradient “A” arch in Google Blue / Yellow / Red) added to `resources/icons/`.
- `--cw-antigravity` CSS variable and `.cw-badge-antigravity` badge class added to the shared theme (Google Blue `#4285F4` dark / `#1a73e8` light).
- Analytics panel: added “Antigravity Sessions” summary card; per-source session counter is now explicit for all sources rather than using a catch-all `else` branch.
- Timeline: Antigravity added to the source filter dropdown and `SRC_LABEL` map; timeline entries get the `cw-badge-antigravity` badge.
- Search panel: source filter cycle expanded to include Antigravity (`All → Copilot → Claude → Antigravity → All`).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-21

- **CI: unit tests on every release** — the release workflow now runs the full test suite on each target platform (Windows, Linux, macOS x64, macOS arm64) before building the VSIX, catching regressions before publication.
- **Cline support** — indexes Cline (`saoudrizwan.claude-dev`) task history from `api_conversation_history.json` per task; mixed text/tool-use content is handled with tool calls silently skipped; model and workspace path read from `ui_messages.json`. Configurable via `chatwizard.indexCline` and `chatwizard.clineStoragePath`.
- **Roo Code support** — indexes Roo Code (`rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline`) task history using the same parser as Cline (identical storage format, different extension ID). Configurable via `chatwizard.indexRooCode` and `chatwizard.rooCodeStoragePath`.
- **Cursor support** — indexes Cursor chat and agent sessions from SQLite `state.vscdb` files (`composer.composerData` key); one `state.vscdb` can contain multiple sessions. Requires the bundled `better-sqlite3` native module. Configurable via `chatwizard.indexCursor` and `chatwizard.cursorStoragePath`.
- **Windsurf support** — indexes Windsurf (Codeium) Cascade sessions from SQLite `state.vscdb` files (`cascade.sessionData` key); reuses the same `better-sqlite3` driver as Cursor. Configurable via `chatwizard.indexWindsurf` and `chatwizard.windsurfStoragePath`.
- **Aider support** — discovers and indexes `.aider.chat.history.md` files in all open VS Code workspace folders and any directories listed in `chatwizard.aiderSearchRoots`; scans up to `chatwizard.aiderSearchDepth` levels deep (default 3, max 5); model read from `.aider.conf.yml` when present. Configurable via `chatwizard.indexAider`, `chatwizard.aiderSearchRoots`, and `chatwizard.aiderSearchDepth`.
- All five new sources participate fully in full-text search, the prompt library, code block extraction, analytics, model usage, timeline, and workspace management.
- Cursor-native model IDs normalised: `cursor-fast` → `Cursor Fast`, `cursor-small` → `Cursor Small`.
- `better-sqlite3` native module bundled with the extension; VSIX packages are built per OS to include the correct platform binary.
- **Session Reader streaming** — large sessions (500+ messages) now load only the most-recent messages on open, with a banner to load earlier history on demand; content is streamed to the webview in small batches so the panel is interactive immediately.
- **Tree view pagination** — Sessions and Code Blocks panels now load items in pages; a "Load More (N remaining)" entry appears at the bottom so the UI stays fast regardless of session count.
- **Session grouping by date** — the Sessions panel now groups sessions into date buckets (Today, Yesterday, This Week, This Month, Older) by default; a toolbar toggle switches between grouped and flat-list views, with the choice persisted across restarts.
- **Code block grouping by language** — the Code Blocks panel now groups entries by language by default; a toolbar toggle switches between grouped and flat-list views, with the choice persisted across restarts.
- **Prompt clustering performance** — near-duplicate detection now uses a MinHash pre-filter to skip full trigram comparison on unrelated pairs, runs in async `setImmediate`-chunked batches to avoid blocking the extension host, caps computation at 5,000 entries, and caches results until the prompt index changes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-22

- **Workspace Management** — new `Manage Watched Workspaces` command lets you select exactly which Copilot and Claude workspaces to index; shows size and session count per workspace; persists selection and restarts the watcher.
- **Model Usage panel** — new sidebar tab showing per-model user request counts over a configurable date range, with workspace and session drill-down and friendly model name normalisation.
- **Timeline enhancements** — added activity heat map (click a day to filter), work burst clustering (2-hour window), per-week topic drift ribbon, summary stats bar (streak, active days, on-this-day), and inline keyword search.
